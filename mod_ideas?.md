No idea if it's possible at all

1. Rest upon travel over X hours (18?)
   No reason some (experienced?) adventurers would go on a death march and spend possibly multiple days walking without resting at all, even worse when some of them are of the squishy, low CON kind.
   Probably above 18 hours simulate a rest that restores the same amount of HP as a normal rest and all spells and Y per day powers or items.
   Then decide the `fatigue` level with a mod 24 hours on the trip duration

Given a 24 hours = 8 hours (rest) + 16 hours (active)

Each 1200 seconds = 20 min increases fatigue by one so 3 points per hour, 3 × 16 = 48 points for a standard day

no way to read in-game clock?

2. compatibility mod between wildmage addition and 5E
