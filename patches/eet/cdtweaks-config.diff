+The settings in this file allow for this mod to be installed in an unattended mode, e.g.
+if you install Tweaks Anthology with the Big World Setup. A handful of components will
+otherwise pause WeiDU and wait for input; defining these values ahead of time in this 
+file will instead use the values defined here instead of waiting on user input in the
+middle of installation.
+
+To use this file, rename it as cdtweaks.txt and leave it in the cdtweaks folder.
