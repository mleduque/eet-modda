        1. Casting slots are determined at install time
        2. Memorization slots are determined at runtime
        3. Ability score-based bonuses are determined at install time AND they only work perfectly if they know
            what the spell table is at install time.
        3rd means you really should not change the spell table after installing ability score-based bonuses.
        Memorization slots will naturally adjust, but the stat-based bonuses may get (slightly) out of whack.
