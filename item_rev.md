> The main component of the mod overwrites existing items and descriptions, and should be installed prior to mods that patch those items. In the case where you'd prefer a file not be altered by IR, you have the option of disabling the specific item modification prior to installing the mod. Details on how to do so can be found in the Installation section below.
>
> The other components of the mod have been designed to patch all items, and should be installed after all mods that add or replace items. Ideally, these components should be installed just after other tweak mods (near the very end of the install). Note that it is possible to install the main component only, exit the installer, install more mods, and then re-start the installer and install other components.
